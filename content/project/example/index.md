# A Cilia Database

CilioGenics is an integrated and open source, community friendly database for ciliary genes. The key goal is to combine a variety of cilia-related data, including single-cell RNA-seq, comparative genomics, aggregation of gene list from cilia-related publications, protein atlas, proteomics, and cilia-specific motifs. Gene search is quick and user friendly, and it connects to a page devoted to the specific gene, which displays a variety of cilia-related information about that gene.

CilioGenics also provides a number of resources to:

* explore the evolutionary dynamics ( the comparative genomics) of each gene in the interactive heatmap

* explore the expression patterns of each gene (whole organisms in C. elegans, and lung tissue in human)

* view proteomics relationship between ciliary proteins and other proteins

* search for the name of gene in each cilia related publications
