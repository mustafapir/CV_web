abstract: The availability of genetic variants, together with phenotypic annotations
  from model organisms, facilitates comparing these variants with equivalent variants
  in humans. However, existing databases and search tools do not make it easy to scan
  for equivalent variants, namely ‘matching variants’ (MatchVars) between humans and
  other organisms. Therefore, we developed an integrated search engine called ConVarT
  (http://www.convart.org/) for matching variants between humans, mice, and Caenorhabditis
  elegans. ConVarT incorporates annotations (including phenotypic and pathogenic)
  into variants, and these previously unexploited phenotypic MatchVars from mice and
  C. elegans can give clues about the functional consequence of human genetic variants.
  Our analysis shows that many phenotypic variants in different genes from mice and
  C. elegans, so far, have no counterparts in humans, and thus, can be useful resources
  when evaluating a relationship between a new human mutation and a disease.
